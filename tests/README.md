### Tests for debugging 

The code in the subfolders was used for debugging our implementation and sanity checking.

The `with_larq` folder contains code to check how a binary neural network behaves with the `larq` library, which is built on top of TensorFlow.

The `with_bytorch` is used for debugging and sanity-checking our own binary neural network implementation in PyTorch.
